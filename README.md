## Description
It's an Arcade Idle made with Unity.
Player manages a club by doing its chores, hiring employees and upgrading them. Player needs to keep customers happy. If not, customers leave. There should be as many customers as possible to maximize money gain.

## Mechanics
- **Queue**\
  _Customers form a queue to get in. Player can let them in from the gate or hire a bodyguard to do the work._
- **Bar**\
  _Customers sit on the bar and ask for beer. Player can prepare the drinks or hire a bartender to do the work. If customer waits too long for a beer, it becomes unhappy._
- **Toilet**\
  _Customers need to go to toilet after having a beer. Toilets break after being used couple of times. Customers start to make a line if there's no available toilet. Player can clean the toilet or hire a cleaner to do the work. If customers wait too long for the toilet, they become unhappy and leave the club._
- **Hiring Employees**\
  _Player can hire employees to do all of the work. There is a cleaner, bartender and two bodyguards. Employees go idle after working for some time. Player has to warn them to make them work again._

- **Dance Floor**\
  _Customers can decide to dance for a while if they are happy._
- **Customer Fighting**\
  _Sometimes customers on dance floor can fight. Player can break the fight or hire a bodyguard to do the work. If nobody breaks the fight, one of the customers faint. After some time they both leave and all the customers become unhappy. If fight is broken, customers continue to the next decision._
